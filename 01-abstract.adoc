== Abstract

This Specification is the formal expression of a data model for the exchange of geochemistry data. It is intended for use by organisations supplying geochemistry results to the Geological Survey of Queensland.

This specification is made of several parts: a data model, a listing of support vocabularies, validators to check the conformance of data to the model and templates that can be used to record data according to the model.

This Specification is issued alongside online testing facilities that allow geochemistry data supply organisations to see example data, validate their data and to read all supporting resources.
