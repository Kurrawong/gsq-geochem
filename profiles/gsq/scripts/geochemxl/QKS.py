    AbsoluteActivity: URIRef  # The "Absolute Activity" is the exponential of the ratio of the chemical potential to \(RT\) where \(R\) is the gas constant and \(T\) the thermodynamic temperature.
    AbsoluteHumidity: URIRef  # "Absolute Humidity" is an amount of water vapor, usually discussed per unit volume. Absolute humidity in air ranges from zero to roughly 30 grams per cubic meter when the air is saturated at \(30 ^\circ C\). The absolute humidity changes as air temperature or pressure changes. This is very inconvenient for chemical engineering calculations, e.g. for clothes dryers, where temperature can vary considerably. As a result, absolute humidity is generally defined in chemical engineering as mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the mass mixing ratio, which is much more rigorous for heat and mass balance calculations. Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above would then be defined as volumetric humidity. Because of the potential confusion.
    AbsorbedDose: URIRef  # "Absorbed Dose" (also known as Total Ionizing Dose, TID) is a measure of the energy deposited in a medium by ionizing radiation. It is equal to the energy deposited per unit mass of medium, and so has the unit \(J/kg\), which is given the special name Gray (\(Gy\)).

It is a vector quantity with dimension \(length/time^{2}\) for linear acceleration, or in the case of angular acceleration, with dimension \(angle/time^{2}\). In SI units, linear acceleration is measured in \(meters/second^{2}\) (\(m \cdot s^{-2}\)) and angular acceleration is measured in \(radians/second^{2}\). In physics, any increase or decrease in speed is referred to as acceleration and similarly, motion in a circle at constant speed is also an acceleration, since the direction component of the velocity is changing.

If the action is represented as an integral over time, taken a the path of the system between the initial time and the final time of the development of the system.The evolution of a physical system between two states is determined by requiring the action be minimized or, more generally, be stationary for small perturbations about the true evolution. This requirement leads to differential equations that describe the true evolution. Conversely, an action principle is a method for reformulating differential equations of motion for a physical system as an equivalent integral equation. Although several variants have been defined (see below), the most commonly used action principle is Hamilton's principle.

The SI unit for amount of substance is \(mole\). It has the unit symbol \(mol\). The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains an equal number of elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012kg of the isotope carbon-12. This number is called Avogadro's number and has the value \(6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}\).

    ElectricPolarization: URIRef  # "Electric Polarization" is the relative shift of positive and negative electric charge in opposite directions within an insulator, or dielectric, induced by an external electric field.

It is a measure of the randomness of molecules in a system and is central to the second law of thermodynamics and the fundamental thermodynamic relation, which deal with physical processes and whether they occur spontaneously.

    Turbidity: URIRef  # Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid, or of air, caused by individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. Turbidity in open water is often caused by phytoplankton and the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. The higher the turbidity, the higher the risk of the drinkers developing gastrointestinal diseases, especially for immune-compromised people, because contaminants like virus or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solid. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly suspended solids can protect bacteria from UV sterilisation of water. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settleable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

    Viscosity: URIRef  # Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed by either shear stress or extensional stress. In general terms it is the resistance of a liquid to flow, or its "thickness". Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. [Wikipedia]. In general conversation or in non-scientific contexts, if someone refers to the viscosity of a fluid, they're likely talking about its dynamic (or absolute) viscosity. However, in engineering or scientific contexts, it's essential to clarify which type of viscosity is being discussed, as the interpretation and use of the data may differ depending on whether one is talking about dynamic or kinematic viscosity.

When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion.Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by:    * linear thermal expansion    * area thermal expansion    * volumetric thermal expansionThese characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications.Some substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients.

It is different from specific heat capacity in that the VHC is a \(\textit{per unit volume}\) measure of the relationship between thermal energy and temperature of a material, while the specific heat is a \(\textit{per unit mass}\) measure (or occasionally per molar quantity of the material).

    WaterHorsepower: URIRef  # No pump can convert all of its mechanical power into water power. Mechanical power is lost in the pumping process due to friction losses and other physical losses. It is because of these losses that the horsepower going into the pump has to be greater than the water horsepower leaving the pump. The efficiency of any given pump is defined as the ratio of the water horsepower out of the pump compared to the mechanical horsepower into the pump.
    Wavelength: URIRef  # For a monochromatic wave, "wavelength" is the distance between two successive points in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront where at a given instant the phase differs by \(2\pi\).

The unit for wavenumber commonly used in spectroscopy is centimetre to power minus one, PER-CM, rather than metre to power minus one, PER-M.
