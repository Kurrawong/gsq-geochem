== Model

This section describes the elements of the model of this specification in detail: lists of the Classes and Predicates of the model which are all taken from the Classes and Properties of the SOSA foreground model <<SOSA, SOSA>> and the background models (<<GSP, GSP>>, <<PROV, PROV>>, <<SDO, SDO>>). All the Classes and Predicates described here are shown in <<whole-model>>.

NOTE: Models such as this are extensible so what you see here is the minimum information needed for geochemistry data. Data suppliers may add other information to geochemistry data as long as they follow normal <<OWL2, OWL>> modelling methods. For example, data suppliers may add additional dataset metadata or information about the sampling system.

=== Classes

The classes (defined in <<Class, 'Class'>>) of this model are those indicated in <<whole-model>>.
