== Profiles

A Profile (capital 'P') is "A specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other specifications"<<PROF>>. In the context of this geochemistry specification, Profiles mandate that certain classes and properties be present in data and that specific vocabularies are used for concept references.

Profiles have separate identity to this specification so that data can indicate conformance specifically to them. Profiles usually provide a series of resources, such as their own textual description of their constraints, supporting vocabularies, validators and examples.

All known profiles of this specification are listed in this section. So far, only two profiles, the _Core_ and the _GSQ_ Profiles, are known.

NOTE: All the resources needed for online validation of data according to all known profiles of this model are available at the https://geochem.dev.kurrawong.ai/[GSQ Geochemistry Data Portal].

==== Specification

The following subsections contain the rules of this Profile and form this Profile's normative specification.

===== Model Element Mandates

The following table lists the requirements for the presence of classes and predicates assigned to classes in data supplied according to this Profile.

A cardinality of `1` means mandatory. `0+` means zero or more, `1+` one more, etc. `0-1` means zero or one only.

|===

===== Data Expansion Rules

Data either in or converted to RDF will be expanded according to the following rules:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Rule | Description

| ObservationCollection properties | Any predicates assigned to an Observation Collection will be applied to individual Observations within the Collection, unless the Observation already has the same predicates assigned to it
| Margin of Error propagation | Any `sdo:marginOfError` predicates assigned to an Observation will propagate to any Results from that Observation, unless the Result already has the `sdo:marginOfError` predicate assigned to it
|===

These rules are implemented as <<SHACL, SHACL>> functions in the _Data Expander_ resource of this profile, see the section above.

==== Validators

Three resources supplied by this Profile assist with the validation of data: the _Validator_, the _Combined Validator & Expander_ and the _JSON Schema_. All are listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above. Depending on the form of data you are supplying (see next section), different validators will apply.

==== Data Forms

Data aiming to be valid according to this Profile can be delivered in one of two forms:

1. Resource Description Framework (*RDF*)
    * must be validated using the _SHACL Validator Combined_ validator, listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above
    * the canonical form of data for this Profile, as per the Geochem Data Model
    * RDF is defined in <<RDF, RDF>>
    * in any of the following RDF triples formats: <<TURTLE, Turtle>>, RDF/XML, JSON-LD, N-Triples. See https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro_to_parsing.html[RDFLib's information on RDF parsing]
2. JavaScript Object Notation (*JSON*)
    * must be validated according to the JSON Schema listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above and the _Combined Validator & Expander_ validator, after converting to RDF
    * the JSON Schema emulates the SHACL Validator's rules and is provided for assistance in forming JSON data

Example implementations of the full conversion & validation processes are provided in the _Python Validate Script_ listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above.

NOTE: Both forms of data can be supplied to and validated in the https://geochem.dev.kurrawong.ai/[GSQ Geochemistry Data Portal] online

==== Examples

See the online directory of example data files for this Profile at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geochem/core/examples.

Each RDF example contains comments at the top of the file indicating what it is demonstrating and/or how it is invalid. Since JSON does not allow comments, see the RDF file with the similar file name for the same information.

=== GSQ Profile

The GSQ Profile of this model mandates certain classes and predicates be present in data and which vocabularies must be used to supply values for predicates that indicate concepts, as described in the <<Where, Vocabularies: Where>> section above.

This Profile is dependent on the Core Profile, thus all data wising to be conformant with this Profile must also be conformant with the Core Profile.

The current version of this Profile is 1.0.0.

[#gsq-profile-specification]
==== Specification

The following subsections contain the rules of this Profile and form this Profile's normative specification. These rules are to be used only in addition to the rules of the Core Profile, no in isolation.

===== Model Element Identifiers

Objects in data supplied claiming conformance to this Profile _MUST_ use a particular forms of <<IRI, IRI>> identifiers, as follows:

|===
| Element                                                   | Identifier Type

| <<sdo:Dataset, Dataset>>                                  | <<Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs, Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs>> or <<External Reference IRIs, External Reference IRIs>>
| <<prov:Attribution, Attribution>>                         | Not needed
| <<prov:Agent, Agent>>                                     | <<GSQ Registered IRIs, GSQ Registered IRIs>>
| <<sosa:ObservationCollection, Observation Collection>>    | <<Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs, Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs>>
| <<sosa:Observation, Observation>>                         | <<Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs, Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs>>
| <<sosa:Result, Result>>                                   | Not needed
| <<sosa:Sample, Sample>>                                   | <<Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs, Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs>> or <<External Reference IRIs, External Reference IRIs>>
| <<sosa:FeatureOfInterest, Feature Of Interest>>           | <<Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs, Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs>> or <<External Reference IRIs, External Reference IRIs>>
| <<geo:Geometry, Geometry>>                                | Not needed
|===

====== Data Supplier Namespaced IRIs

Each Data Supplier will be allocated an IRI identifier namespace to use. For example _ACME Corp._ might be allocated the namespace `+https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/qgc/agme-corp/+` and will be able to created identifiers such as this for 'Dataset X': `+https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/qgc/agme-corp/dataset-x+`.

The only rules for Data Supplier Namespace use are:

1. The IRIs created must be valid according to <<RFC3986, RFC3986>>
** This generally means no spaces or unusual characters that break IRIs (URLs)
2. Unique IRIs must always be formed
** If a Data Supplier creates `+https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/qgc/agme-corp/obs-00103+` for an <<sosa:Observation, Observation>>, they can not use that identifier again, at any later stage. This entails keeping track of the ID bit of the identifier - `obs-00103`.
** Data deemed valid but with duplicate IRIs will be returned to Data Suppliers for updating

NOTE: For test data, use the "Data Supplier Namespaced" namespace of `+https://placeholder.com/+`, e.g. for 'Dataset X': `+https://placeholder.com/dataset-x+`

====== GSQ Registered IRIs

Agents will need IRIs registered

====== External Reference ID

If a <<sdo:Dataset, Dataset>>, <<sosa:Sample, Sample>> or a

====== External Reference IRIs

TODO

===== Vocabulary Restrictions

This profile requires that Concepts indicated by certain predicates come from specific vocabularies. The predicates and their required vocabularies are:

|===
| Predicate | Vocabulary

| <<sosa:usedProcedure, used procedure>>        | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geochem-methods[Analytical methods for geochemistry]
| <<sosa:observedProperty, observed property>>  | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/observable-properties[Observable Properties]
| <<sdo:unitCode, unit code>>                   | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geou[Geoscience Profile of QUDT Units], Geochemistry collection
| <<prov:hadRole, had role>>                    | https://data.idnau.org/pid/vocab/idn-role-codes[IDN Role Codes]
| <<prov:agent, agent>>                         | To be supplied by GSQ via the https://geochem.dev.kurrawong.ai/[GSQ Geochemistry Data Portal]
| <<sdo:additionalType, additional type>>       | When used on <<sosa:Sample, Sample>> objects: https://linked.data.gov.au/def/sample-type[Sample Types]
|===

Note that this profile does _NOT_ require that the predicate <<sosa:madeBySensor, made by sensor>> is used on the <<sosa:Observation, Observation>> class, thus no vocabulary is mandated for its use. It may be used but, if it is, the user may choose any vocabulary of Concepts to draw from useful to them.

==== Validators

Four resources supplied by this Profile assist with the validation of data: the _SHACL Validator_, the _SHACL Combined Validator_, the _JSON Schema_ and the _Excel to RDF Converter_. All are listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above. Depending on the form of data you are supplying (see next section), different validators will apply.

==== Data Forms

Data aiming to be valid according to this Profile can be delivered in one of three forms: the same two as the Core profile above, RDF & JSON, and also:

1. *RDF*
    * See the Core Profile
2. *JSON*
    * See the Core Profile
3. *Excel*
    * must use the Excel templates provided with this Profile, see the <<Resources, Resources>> section
    * will be converted to RDF using the Excel-to-RDF program also supplied with this Profile
    * then validated according to the _SHACL Validator Combined_ validator, listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above

Example implementations of the full conversion & validation processes are provided in the _Python Validate Script_ listed in the <<Resources, Resources>> section above.

NOTE: All three forms of data can be supplied to and validated in the https://geochem.dev.kurrawong.ai/[GSQ Geochemistry Data Portal] online

==== Examples

See the online directory of example data files for this Profile at https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geochem/gsq/examples.

Each RDF example contains comments at the top of the file indicating what it is demonstrating and/or how it is invalid. Excel files contain comments in a 'Comments' worksheet. Since JSON does not allow comments, see the RDF file with the similar file name for the same information.
